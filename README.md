# BlazoriseTemplate

I created BlazoriseTemplate to avoid having to create a default Blazorise project and then having to add/delete/edit the same files on every single project. This just streamlines that process for a quicker start.

## Usage

Start by cloning this repo `git clone https://github.com/bolst/BlazoriseTemplate.git` or just download the repo and extract.

Run the script and go through the prompts
```
python MakeApp.py
```

Done!

## TODO

Include authentication
